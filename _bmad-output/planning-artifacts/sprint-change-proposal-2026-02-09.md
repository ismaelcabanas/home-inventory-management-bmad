# Sprint Change Proposal

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Project:** home-inventory-management-bmad
**Requested By:** User (Isma)
**Change Scope:** Minor

---

## 1. Issue Summary

**Problem Statement:** The current Inventory page UX has several friction points discovered through competitive analysis and user feedback:

1. **Wasted horizontal space** - Layout doesn't use full screen width
2. **Redundant stock level buttons** - All 4 buttons visible at all times creates visual clutter
3. **Search placement** - Search bar at top takes prime real estate but is a secondary action
4. **Navigation confusion** - Scan button always visible in nav, but only relevant when shopping

**Context:** UX review conducted with Sally (UX Designer agent) comparing current implementation against competitor apps. User identified specific improvements to make the interface cleaner and more efficient.

**Evidence:**
- Screenshot review of current inventory page
- Competitive analysis of similar list/inventory apps
- User feedback on navigation mental model

## 2. Impact Analysis

### Epic Impact
| Epic | Status | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| Epic 1-6 | Done/In-progress | No changes to existing epics |
| **Epic 7** | NEW | UX Improvements & Polish |

### Story Impact
- **New Story:** 7-1-redesign-inventory-page-layout-and-navigation
- **Affected Stories:** None (new work, no conflicts)

### Artifact Conflicts
| Artifact | Change Required |
|----------|-----------------|
| epics.md | Add Epic 7 + Story 7.1 |
| sprint-status.yaml | Add Epic 7 tracking entries |
| PRD | No changes required |
| Architecture | No changes required |
| UX Design | No changes required (enhancement aligned with existing UX principles) |

### Technical Impact
- Modify `BottomNav.tsx` - Reduce from 3 tabs to 2 tabs
- Modify product card components - Add tap-to-cycle stock level
- Add new CSS for gradient backgrounds on cards
- Reposition search bar and FAB in inventory layout

---

## 3. Recommended Approach

**Chosen Path:** Direct Adjustment - Add new epic and story within existing plan

**Rationale:**
- No conflicts with existing completed work
- Post-MVP polish that enhances (doesn't change) core functionality
- Clear scope with specific acceptance criteria
- Can be implemented incrementally

**Effort Estimate:** Medium (2-3 story points)
- UI layout changes: ~2 hours
- Tap-to-cycle interaction: ~1 hour
- Navigation simplification: ~1 hour
- Testing: ~1 hour

**Risk Assessment:** Low
- No breaking changes to existing features
- Visual only, no data model changes
- Easily reversible if issues arise

## 4. Detailed Change Proposals

### Change 1: Add Epic 7 to epics.md

**Section:** After Epic 6 (end of file)

**Added Content:**
- Epic 7: UX Improvements & Polish (header section)
- Story 7.1: Redesign Inventory Page Layout and Navigation (full story)

**Status:** ✅ Applied

---

### Change 2: Update sprint-status.yaml

**Added Entries:**
```yaml
epic-7: in-progress
7-1-redesign-inventory-page-layout-and-navigation: backlog
epic-7-retrospective: optional
```

**Status:** ✅ Applied

## 5. Implementation Handoff

### Change Scope Classification: Minor

**Route to:** Development team for direct implementation

### Deliverables:
1. ✅ Epic 7 added to epics.md
2. ✅ Story 7.1 with complete acceptance criteria
3. ✅ Sprint status updated with backlog entry
4. ✅ Technical implementation notes included

### Next Steps:
1. Run `create-story` workflow to generate full story file from epics.md
2. Run `dev-story` workflow to implement Story 7.1
3. Test changes on mobile devices
4. Code review via `code-review` workflow

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Inventory page uses full width with edge-to-edge cards
- [ ] Tap-to-change stock level works correctly (cycling: High → Medium → Low → Empty)
- [ ] Card backgrounds show color-coded gradients for stock levels
- [ ] Search bar and Add FAB positioned below products, above navigation
- [ ] Bottom navigation shows only 2 tabs (Inventory, Shopping)
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
